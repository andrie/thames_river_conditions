## River conditions


::: {.column-margin}
This river conditions information is collated daily from <http://riverconditions.environment-agency.gov.uk/> and is updated at 5am every day. 
:::

```{python}
import hcc as hcc
df = hcc.scrape_conditions()
show(
    df,  
    search={"search": "Local"},
    columnDefs = [{
        "targets": "_all",
        "createdCell": JavascriptFunction(
            """
            function (td, cellData, rowData, row, col) {
                if (cellData == "Caution strong stream") {$(td).css('background-color', 'red').css('color', 'white');}
                if (cellData == "Caution stream increasing") {$(td).css('background-color', '#FFE010');}
                if (cellData == "Caution stream decreasing") {$(td).css('background-color', '#FFE010');}

## River flow rate

::: {.column-margin}
Flow rate is the volume of water passing a point in a river per unit time. It is measured in cubic metres per second (m3/s), also known as Cumecs.

A flow rate of about **100 cumecs** at Walton seems to be the range when **yellow caution** (stream increasing) appear, and higher than **150 cumecs** when the **red caution** (strong stream) appear.
:::


::: {.panel-tabset}

### Walton
```{python}
hcc.plot_thames_level("Walton", parameter = "flow")
```

### Kingston

```{python}
hcc.plot_thames_level("Kingston", parameter = "flow")
```

## Water levels

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Sunbury Lock

```{python}
hcc.plot_thames_level("Sunbury", position = "downstream")
```

::: {.column-margin}
What does the Sunbury lock water level mean at the club house?

5.05m : water lapping over step to club house, canoe drying area under water (all time peak reached on 2014-11-02)

4.95m : car park under water, canoe drying area a bit wet

4.50m : car park half under water, canoe drying area high and dry

4.00m : car park dry but river still in flood

3.19m : flooding possible in Sunbury

2.8m  : river flow is strong, roughly 100 cumecs at Kingston, about the level where the yellow boards appear

2.4m  : typical flow rate when river flow is low

:::

### Richmond Lock


```{python}
hcc.plot_thames_level("Richmond", river_name = "Thames Tideway")
```
