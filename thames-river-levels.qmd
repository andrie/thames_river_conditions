## River conditions


::: {.column-margin}
This river conditions information is collated daily from <http://riverconditions.environment-agency.gov.uk/> and is updated at 5am every day. 
:::

```{python}
import hcc as hcc
df = hcc.scrape_conditions()
show(df,  search={"search": "Local"})
```


## Flow rate at Kingston

::: {.column-margin}
Flow rate is the volume of water passing a point in a river per unit time. It is measured in cubic metres per second (m3/s), also known as Cumecs.

A flow rate of **100-150 cumecs** seems to be the range when **yellow boards** appear, and higher than **150 cumecs** when the **red boards** appear.

Negative flow rate means that the incoming tide is high and river flow is actually upstream.

```{python}
hcc.plot_thames_level("Kingston", parameter = "flow")
```



## Water levels

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Sunbury Lock

```{python}
hcc.plot_thames_level("Sunbury", position = "downstream")
```

::: {.column-margin}
What does the Sunbury lock water level mean at the club house?

5.05m : water lapping over step to club house, canoe drying area under water (all time peak reached on 2014-11-02)

4.95m : car park under water, canoe drying area a bit wet

4.50m : car park half under water, canoe drying area high and dry

4.00m : car park dry but river still in flood

3.19m : flooding possible in Sunbury

2.8m  : river flow is strong, roughly 100 cumecs at Kingston, about the level where the yellow boards appear

2.4m  : typical flow rate when river flow is low

:::

### Richmond Lock


```{python}
hcc.plot_thames_level("Richmond", river_name = "Thames Tideway")
```
